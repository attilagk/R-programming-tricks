# R you experienced?

The idea of this little collection of toy analyses came about when I studied language-independent programming concepts.  I wondered how I could lift those general programming concepts into my everyday work in computational and statistical genomics.  I knew that once I managed to implement some general concept in R---and so learn a new R idiom---in the context of a specific problem from then on that R idiom would serve me well in other contexts.
